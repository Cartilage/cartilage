# Cartilage Release History

## Version 0.9.5 â€” Not Yet Released

 * [CallConduit.Views.SplitView] Added setFirstView and setSecondView methods
   for replacing the views without a full re-rendering of the split view
   instance.

 * [Cartilage.View] Introduced View#observe for binding event observers to
   the current view (to be used in place of Object#on). Observed events will
   automatically be cleaned up when the view is removed.

 * [Cartilage.View] Renamed View#dismiss to View#cleanup. This method should
   be overridden in subclasses, where necessary, to perform any view cleanup
   when the view is removed. It should be called whenever you are manually
   removing a view, in place of View#remove.

 * [Cartilage.Views.SourceListView] Added SourceListView for use as sidebars
   with some default styling.

 * [Cartilage.Views.MatrixView] Allow drag-selection to be enabled/disabled by
   setting the allowsDragSelection property. Defaults to false.

 * [Cartilage.Views.MatrixView] Hide the overlay when rendering to prevent a
   1x1 pixel artifact being visible.

 * [Cartilage.Views.MatrixView] Only begin drag operations on left mouse
   button clicks.

 * [Cartilage.Views.ModalView] Made the modal view class responsible for
   display in addition to dismissal, preventing more than one instance from
   being displayed at once.

 * [Cartilage.Views.ListView] Fixed an issue when expanding selection to
   another element in the list (or matrix).

 * [Cartilage.Views.SplitView] Added support for redrawing the view when the
   window is resized.

 * Initial port of Aphid to Backbone.js and Bootstrap.
